# App Vision Generator Prompt

I want to create a vision document for a new application. Please ask me detailed questions to understand my app idea and then generate a comprehensive vision similar to professional product specifications. 

Ask me questions about:

## 1. Core Problem & Solution
- What main problem does this app solve?
- Who is the target user?
- What's the primary user workflow or interaction pattern?

## 2. Key Features & Capabilities
- What are the 3-5 main features?
- What makes each feature special or different?
- Are there any AI/automation components?

## 3. User Experience Philosophy
- How should users interact with the app?
- What should be automatic vs manual?
- What's the learning curve like?

## 4. Integrations & Connections
- Does it connect to external services (email, cloud storage, APIs)?
- What file types or data sources does it work with?
- Any third-party platforms to integrate with?

## 5. Technical Approach
- Is this a desktop app, web app, or mobile app?
- Any specific technology requirements?
- Local processing vs cloud-based?

## 6. End Goal & Success Metrics
- What's the ultimate user outcome?
- How will users' lives be better?
- What does success look like?

## 7. Output Location
- Where would you like me to save the vision document?

## Output Format

After I answer your questions, create a compelling README-style vision document with:
- A clear tagline and description
- Structured feature sections with emojis
- Emphasis on user benefits and workflow
- Professional tone but accessible language
- Technical setup section appropriate for the platform
